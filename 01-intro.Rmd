[**You:**]{.ul} "Jonathan, what is your senior thesis?".

[**Me:**]{.ul} "Oh, it's a hodgepodge of R packages and projects I've developed. I have something for behavioral-genetics modeling, creating and deploying surveys, conducting randomized-trials, interfacing with the GitHub API, and more."

[**You:**]{.ul} "Wow! That's so cool. How does it relate to your major?"

[**Me:**]{.ul} "Good question! In order to determine statistical significance for a question-of-interest, many researchers (especially in the life sciences) employ randomized-controlled studies. They are the 'gold standard for effectiveness research' because they help reduce bias when examining causal relationships [@hariton2018]. In the neuroscience literature specifically, a lot of behavioral data is collected and correlated with neuroimaging data. Some of the work I've done to facilitate easy creation and deployment of surveys, as well as provide a framework for randomized-controlled studies, helps make that process easier."

[**You:**]{.ul} "What about the GitHub API interface and behavioral-genetics modeling work?"

[**Me:**]{.ul} "Also good question! GitHub is a code hosting platform that facilitates collaboration between programmers all over the world. It's especially useful because it allows you to version-control your work (i.e. save a copy at every stage and easily revert back to older work as needed). The behavioral-genetics modeling is simply one way I exercised the computational techniques (both mathematical and technical) I have learned while pursuing my degree."

[**You:**]{.ul} "Well, okay then! How can I hear about these in more detail?"

[**Me:**]{.ul} "I'm so glad you asked! You can read about them on this website I created for my senior thesis. That is, at [senior-thesis.jdtrat.com](https://senior-thesis.jdtrat.com). There, I describe in-depth the theoretical and technical details involved in my work, why it matters, and how it can (and is already) helping other people."
