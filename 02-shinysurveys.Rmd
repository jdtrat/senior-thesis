# Motivation

Surveys are extremely useful tools for gathering information from individuals on a large scale and are used in a variety of domains. Within the medical research field, for example, there are often three types of surveys: epidemiological questionnaires, ones on attitudes towards health services or interventions, and polls to assess knowledge about specific topics [@jones2013]. Neuroscientific research often uses them to correlate behaviors (e.g. political ideology or X) with neuroimaging data (see [@ahn2014] as an example).

The ability to easily collect and analyze survey data is, therefore, extremely important. Many platforms provide user-friendly methods to do this. [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/), and [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/core-xm/survey-software/) are all popular options.
