<p>My name is Jonathan Trattner. In May 2021, I will graduate with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Computational Neuroscience from <a href="https://wfu.edu">Wake Forest University</a>. This website is the embodiment of my honor’s thesis, and it showcases a few of the exciting software tools I’ve developed during my time at Wake Forest. Projects that I’ve worked on this past year are used by over 3,000 people.</p>

<p>Technically, Wake Forest does not have a major in Computational Neuroscience. Students who wish to study a topic not available through a specific department, though, may propose an <em>Interdisciplinary Major</em>. It’s not the most clear-cut process. Honestly, I would not recommend it for most people. There’s a lot of institutional red-tape to wade through. But, I am really glad that I did it.</p>

<p>In high school, I read the book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> by Israeli Psychologist and Nobel Laureate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>. It introduced me to the field of behavioral economics. At the time, I was taking AP Psychology and just got interested in the psychology of how people make decisions. When I got to Wake, I enrolled in Introduction to Neuroscience with the amazing Katy Lack. That class really whet my appetite for all things neuroscience, and I became interested in the five-year <a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/Education-and-Training/Graduate-Programs/Graduate-Programs-in-Neuroscience/5Year-Dual-Degree">combined Bachelor’s/Master’s degree in Neuroscience</a> that Wake offered. I met with the program director, <a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/Faculty/M/Carol-Milligan">Carol Milligan</a>, and she introduced me to this newly hired professor, <a href="https://kishidalab.com">Ken Kishida</a>. His lab uses behavioral tasks and neuroimaging methods to explore the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying decision-making. I’ve been working with Ken since spring 2018 and our work really inspired me to design my own major.</p>

</h2>
<p>While working with Ken on my master’s thesis, I developed an interest in the programming language R. I took a course in Statistical Learning with the brilliant <a href="https://www.lucymcgowan.com">Lucy D’Agostino McGowan</a> and asked her if she would be my thesis advisor. Fortunately for me, she said yes. Working with her over the past year has been an incredible learning experience. Together</p>
<p>I’ve had the privilege of working with so many intelligent, kind, and talented people, and have had many wonderful role models to look up at. I’d like to make as my brilliant mentor, <a href="https://www.lucymcgowan.com">Lucy D’Agostino McGowan</a>.</p>
<p>Often times I get asked what my major is and I say Computational Neuroscience. I then get some form of “Oh, wow. What do you want to do with that? Neurosurgery? Artificial Intelligence?”</p>
<p>I was introduced to <a href="https://kishidalab.com">Ken Kishida</a></p>
<p>So, what is it exactly?</p>
