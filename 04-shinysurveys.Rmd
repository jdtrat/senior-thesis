## What is {shiny}? {#what-is-shiny}

### Technical Aspects {#technical-aspects}

Websites are predominantly built using three languages:

1.  HTML for defining the structure of websites
2.  CSS for customizing the aesthetics of websites
3.  JavaScript for controlling the behavior of websites

At a high-level, {shiny} allows programmers to combine the computational strengths of R with the interactivity of web applications. {shiny} provides a curated set of functions that generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to create web applications[@hadleywickham2020].

A simple {shiny} application consists of two elements: `ui` (user-interface) and `server`. The former, defines what an individual will see when they visit the application and the latter defines the computations performed. For example, you can define a simple application that accepts a name, adds a greeting, and displays the result using a few lines of code:

```{r shinyapp-textInput-code, eval = FALSE}
# load the package
library(shiny)

# define a user-interface with two elements: a text input with an ID, label, and
# initial value; a textOutput that returns the input + greeting
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput(inputId = "nameInput", label = "What is your name?", value = "World"),
  textOutput("name")
)

# define the server side logic to manipulate the inputs
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # define the output that concatenates the strings "Hello, " + user input + "."
  output$name <- renderText({paste0("Hello, ", input$nameInput, ".")})
}

# run the application
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

When run in a browser, this code produces the following application:

```{r shinyapp-textInput-gif, include = knitr::is_html_output()}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("graphics/shinyapp_textInput.gif"))
```

```{r shinyapp-textInput-png, include = knitr::is_latex_output()}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("graphics/shinyapp_textInput.png"))
```

### Usage {#usage}

{shiny} is used in many disciplines. DePalma, Turnidge, and Craig (2017) developed an application that allows physicians to utilize complex mathematical methods of determining microbial resistance to antibiotics[@depalma2017].

Kandlikar and colleagues (2018) developed an application, *ranacapa*, to explore environmental DNA sequences that is used to engage and educate professionals and students alike. It allowed resource managers at the Channel Islands National Park Service to filter their observed species down to "a particular set of key taxa that they regularly monitor" and allowed students with "no prior bioinformatics experience" to gain an understanding of their eDNA samples, allowing their instructors to focus on "biological questions rather than on troubleshooting bioinformatics problems" [@kandlikar2018].

```{r add-industry-example}
details::details(c("Add an example of {shiny} in industry. Mastering Shiny references Silicon Valley metrics. Maybe ask R4DS members?"), summary = "Add Industry Example")
```

{shiny} is "used in almost as many niches and industries as R itself is" [@hadleywickham2020]. As such, the work presented in this section is usable in many contexts.

## Motivation {#motivation}

Surveys are extremely useful tools for gathering information from individuals on a large scale and are used in a variety of domains. Within the medical research field, for example, there are often three types of surveys: epidemiological questionnaires, ones on attitudes towards health services or interventions, and polls to assess knowledge about specific topics [@jones2013]. Neuroscientific research often uses them to correlate behaviors (e.g. political ideology or X) with neuroimaging data (see [@ahn2014] as an example).

The ability to easily collect and analyze survey data is, therefore, extremely important. Many platforms provide user-friendly methods to do this. [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/), and [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/core-xm/survey-software/) are all popular options. For many cases, they work extremely well. One limitation, though, is often the ease with which they integrate with existing data analysis and/or research pipelines. Because of R's prevalence in academia and research [@rstudio2018a; @carson2016], {shinysurveys} was developed to streamline the data collection and analysis process. To do this, we utilized a package called {shiny}, which makes it easy to build interactive web applications with R [@chang2021].

## A survey of {shinysurveys} {#survey-of-shinysurveys}

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(shinysurveys)
library(tibble)
```

Surveys are ubiquitous in data science. A clear example is a simple demographic form. Our package allows you to easily create questionnaires using Shiny.[^1] We provide two functions to do this: `surveyOutput()` and `renderSurvey()`. Both of these functions take in a data frame containing question information that follows a specific format. To illustrate them in use, we will show you a questionnaire from McGowan et al. (unpublished) that is built into the `shinysurveys` package:

[^1]: We assume that you are familiar with the basic layout of a Shiny application. If not, please check out RStudio's [great resources](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) before completing this vignette.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions
```

As seen, this is a tidy data frame, where each row is a unique observation and each column is a variable. While there are 54 rows, there are only 11 unique questions:

```{r display unique questions}
unique(shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions$question)
```

Each question has seven variables that dictate how it functions within the survey. They are described in the data set documentation, accessed by calling `?shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions` in your console, as follows:

-   *question*: The question to be asked.
-   *option*: A possible response to the question. In multiple choice questions, for example, this would be the possible answers. For questions without discrete answers, such as a numeric input, this would be the default option shown on the input. For text inputs, it is the placeholder value.
-   *input_type*: What type of response is expected? Currently supported types include `numeric`, `mc` for multiple choice, `text`, `select`,and `y/n` for yes/no questions.
-   *input_id*: The input id for Shiny inputs.
-   *dependence*: Does this question (row) depend on another? That is, should it only appear if a different question has a specific value? This column contains the input_id of whatever question this one depends upon.
-   *dependence_value*: This column contains the specific value that the dependence question must take for this question (row) to be shown.
-   *required*: logical TRUE/FALSE signifying if a question is required.

### Examples

Below are examples of the currently supported question types. We provide a thorough explanation for the numeric input, but only point out notable differences for other inputs.

#### Numeric Input

A good example of a numeric input is the first question: "What's your age?":

```{r what is your age preview, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "age")
```

As we noted in the [introduction](#Introduction), this row shows us that the question is "What's your age?". We know we are expecting a numeric input by looking at the `input_type` column, and the default value is equal to 25 according to the `option` column.[^2]

[^2]: It is important to note that the option column for numeric inputs provides the default value, but for other types -- as we will see -- provides the possible options for a question.

We can also tell that there are no dependency questions. This means that no matter what value you enter, no follow-up question will appear. Lastly, we know this is a required question.[^3]

[^3]: Required question functionality will be discussed in more detail in the section [Required Questions](#required_questions).

![](graphics/numeric_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

#### Multiple Choice (mc) Input {#multiple_choice}

An example of this is the question "Which best describes your gender?":

```{r what is your gender mc, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "gender" | input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

Unlike numeric inputs, the `option` column represents each of the possible responses for this question. You may notice that the fifth row of this question has *NA* in the `option` column and "text" in the `input_type` column. We will discuss this in more detail [below](#Question%20Dependencies), but for now note that this question has a dependent. That is, if a specific option is chosen for this question, a new one will appear below. In this case, a question that accepts text as its input.

![](graphics/mc_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

#### Text Input {#text_input}

Questions that need text-based input should specify "text" in the `input_type` column. As noted in the previous example, the following is a dependent of the question "Which best describes your gender?":

```{r what is your gender text, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

It's important to note that, as previously mentioned, the `option` column for text-based inputs corresponds to a placeholder value. It can be left blank (i.e. NA) or contain a character string. If they are left empty, the text field will display "Placeholder" as seen below. Otherwise, the character string will be displayed.

![](graphics/text_input_placeholder.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![](graphics/text_input_character_string.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="290" height="71"}

#### Select Input

Select inputs are great when there are many potential, discretely defined, response choices.[^4] An example is the question "What was your first language?" which contains `r nrow(subset(teaching_r_questions, question == "What was your first language?"))` 15 options (rows):[^5]

[^4]: As of October 2020, these do not support multiple options selected at once, though we anticipate adding this functionality in the future.

[^5]: Note the presence of the NA in the output above. This deals with question dependencies, which is explained in detail in the section [Dependency Questions](#Question%20Dependencies).

```{r show first language options, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, question == "What was your first language?")$option
```

![](graphics/select_input_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

#### Yes or No (y/n) Input

Yes or no questions are self-explanatory. An example is the question "Have you ever learned to program in R?":

```{r learned to program in R, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "learned_r")
```

![](graphics/yes_no_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

### Implementing Surveys in Shiny

#### UI Function

`surveyOutput()` takes in a data frame of the form described above. You may also add a title and description for your survey with the arguments `survey_title` and `survey_description`, though these are optional. Further documentation can be accessed by typing `?shinysurveys::surveyOutput()` in the console.

#### Server Function

`renderSurvey()` takes in a data frame of the form described above. It also takes in a `theme` color to style your survey. Typical names such as "red" or "blue" work, as well as hex color codes such as "\#63B8FF" (the default theme). The documentation for it can be accessed by typing `?shinysurveys::renderSurvey()` in the console.

#### Basic Survey

A minimal example of a survey can be created with this template:

```{r run survey, eval = FALSE}
library(shinysurveys)
ui <- shiny::fluidPage(
  shinysurveys::surveyOutput(df = shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions,
                             survey_title = "A minimal title",
                             survey_description = "A minimal description")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  shinysurveys::renderSurvey(df = shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions)
}

shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Please note that the UI comes with a "Submit" button included. Survey designers can customize actions by using the call `input$submit`. Some examples would be saving or displaying user responses, or displaying a message as seen on the [gif here](https://www.jdtrat.com/packages/shinysurveys/index.html#demos).

### Advanced Features

#### Dependency Questions

We use the term question dependencies in reference to the situations where a question should only be shown (i.e. asked) if a specific response is given to a preceding question. The questions included with the `shinysurveys` package contain many dependencies. One example we've seen discussing [multiple choice](#multiple_choice) and [text-based](#text_input) questions is the dependent for "Which best describes your gender?"

```{r what is your gender - question dependencies, echo = FALSE}
subset(teaching_r_questions, input_id == "gender" | input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

Focusing on the columns `dependence` and `dependence_value`, we see that the text-based question will only show if the multiple choice one, with the input id of "gender" takes on the value "Prefer to self describe." That is, a question with non *NA* values in the `dependence` and `dependence_value` columns mean that it will only show if the question with the input id from `dependence` takes on the value from `dependence_value`. This can be seen below:

![](graphics/dependency_example_1.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![](graphics/dependency_example_2.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

#### Required Questions {#required_questions}

Survey designers can define questions that must be answered by adding the value TRUE to the `required` column. If a required question is not answered, the user will not be able to submit their responses.

![](graphics/required_submit_disabled.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![](graphics/required_submit_enabled.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

#### User Tracking

Built into the survey is the ability to track users based on URL parameters. If you deploy your survey on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io), or run it locally in a browser, you can add a URL parameter after the backslash as follows: `?user_id=12345`. A live demo can be found here: <https://jdtrat-apps.shinyapps.io/shinysurveys_user_tracking/?user_id=hadley>
