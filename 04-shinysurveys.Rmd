## What is {shiny}? {#what-is-shiny}

### Technical Aspects {#technical-aspects}

Websites are predominantly built using three languages:

1.  HTML for defining the structure of websites
2.  CSS for customizing the aesthetics of websites
3.  JavaScript for controlling the behavior of websites

At a high-level, {shiny} allows programmers to combine the computational strengths of R with the interactivity of web applications. {shiny} provides a curated set of functions that generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to create web applications[@hadleywickham2020].

A simple {shiny} application consists of two elements: `ui` (user-interface) and `server`. The former, defines what an individual will see when they visit the application and the latter defines the computations performed. For example, you can define a simple application that accepts a name, adds a greeting, and displays the result using a few lines of code:

```{r shinyapp-textInput-code, eval = FALSE}
# load the package
library(shiny)

# define a user-interface with two elements: a text input with an ID, label, and
# initial value; a textOutput that returns the input + greeting
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput(inputId = "nameInput", label = "What is your name?", value = "World"),
  textOutput("name")
)

# define the server side logic to manipulate the inputs
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # define the output that concatenates the strings "Hello, " + user input + "."
  output$name <- renderText({paste0("Hello, ", input$nameInput, ".")})
}

# run the application
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

When run in a browser, this code produces the following application:

```{r shinyapp-textInput-gif, include = knitr::is_html_output()}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("graphics/shinyapp_textInput.gif"))
```

```{r shinyapp-textInput-png, include = knitr::is_latex_output()}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("graphics/shinyapp_textInput.png"))
```

### Usage {#usage}

{shiny} is used in many disciplines. DePalma, Turnidge, and Craig (2017) developed an application that allows physicians to utilize complex mathematical methods of determining microbial resistance to antibiotics[@depalma2017].

Kandlikar and colleagues (2018) developed an application, *ranacapa*, to explore environmental DNA sequences that is used to engage and educate professionals and students alike. It allowed resource managers at the Channel Islands National Park Service to filter their observed species down to "a particular set of key taxa that they regularly monitor" and allowed students with "no prior bioinformatics experience" to gain an understanding of their eDNA samples, allowing their instructors to focus on "biological questions rather than on troubleshooting bioinformatics problems" [@kandlikar2018].

```{r add-industry-example}
details(c("Add an example of {shiny} in industry. Mastering Shiny references Silicon Valley metrics. Maybe ask R4DS members?"), summary = "Add Industry Example")
```

{shiny} is "used in almost as many niches and industries as R itself is" [@hadleywickham2020]. As such, the work presented in this section is usable in many contexts.

## Motivation {#motivation}

Surveys are extremely useful tools for gathering information from individuals on a large scale and are used in a variety of domains. Within the medical research field, for example, there are often three types of surveys: epidemiological questionnaires, ones on attitudes towards health services or interventions, and polls to assess knowledge about specific topics [@jones2013]. Neuroscientific research often uses them to correlate behaviors (e.g. political ideology or X) with neuroimaging data (see [@ahn2014] as an example).

The ability to easily collect and analyze survey data is, therefore, extremely important. Many platforms provide user-friendly methods to do this. [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/), and [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/core-xm/survey-software/) are all popular options. For many cases, they work extremely well. One limitation, though, is often the ease with which they integrate with existing data analysis and/or research pipelines. Because of R's prevalence in academia and research [@rstudio2018a; @carson2016], {shinysurveys} was developed to streamline the data collection and analysis process. To do this, we utilized a package called {shiny}, which makes it easy to build interactive web applications with R [@chang2021].
